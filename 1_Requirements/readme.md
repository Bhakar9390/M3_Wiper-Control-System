 # DESCRIPTION
 
   1. STM32F407VG
 
 * The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family is based on the high-performance Arm® Cortex®-M4 32-bit RISC core operating at a frequency of up to 168 MHz. The Cortex-M4 core features a Floating point unit (FPU) single precision which supports all Arm single-precision data-processing instructions and data types. It also implements a full set of DSP instructions and a memory protection unit (MPU) which enhances application security. The STM32F405xx and STM32F407xx family incorporates high-speed embedded

  2. LED
  
  * A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it. Electrons in the semiconductor recombine with electron holes, releasing energy in the form of photons

   3. Push Button
  
  * Push buttons can be explained as simple power controlling switches of a machine or appliance. These are generally metal or thermoplastic switches that are    intended to grant easy access to the user.
  
   4. Resistors
  
  * A resistor controls the flow of the electrical current within a circuit. Resistors are made from materials like copper or carbon, which make it difficult for the electrical charges to flow through a circuit.
  
   5. Power Supply
  
  * A power supply is an electronic circuit that converts the voltage of an alternating current (AC) into a direct current (DC) voltage. It is basically consisting of the following elements: transformer, rectifier, filter and regulator circuits.
  
 # FEATURES OF STM32F407VG MICROCONTROLLER
   * Up to 1 Mbyte of Flash memory.
   * Up to 192+4 Kbytes of SRAM including 64-Kbyte of CCM (core coupled memory) data RAM.
   * 512 bytes of OTP memory.
   * Flexible static memory controller supporting Compact Flash, SRAM, PSRAM, NOR and NAND memories.
 
 # WORKING PRINCIPLE
 
 * Assume that the automobile is the microcontroller. If the button is hit, the first led (red) will turn on, Clicking again the wiper will start, and the second led (blue) will turn on for a desired rate. If the button is pressed again, the third led (green) will turn on, and the wiper's speed will be increased in comparison to the previous one. The fourth press will turn on the fourth led (orange), and the wiper speed will be increased in accordance with the previous one. The microcontroller (vehicle) is turned off after the fifth click.
 
 # USES
 
 # 4W & H (WHO,WHAT,WHEN,WHERE,HOW):

# WHAT:
* The functional speed of a vehicle wiper is constrained by a wiper speed control instrument in view of downpour conditions. To produce, the control framework consolidates a downpour sensor (30) that identifies downpour conditions. The adequacy of a simple sign relies upon the identified downpour conditions.

# WHY:
* To keep the windscreen clean enough to give adequate view at all times. 
* The windshield wipers remove rain and snow from the windshield, while the headlights improve visibility at night.

# WHO:
* A wiper speed control system for an automobile manages the wiper's functioning speed in response to weather conditions.

# HOW:
* You can adjust the speed of the car wiper system according to the rainfall.
